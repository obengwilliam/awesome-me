[Managing Data in microservices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8-e-3fRHBw)

-  Modern software development is set around organisation(small teams), practices(add, continuous delivery), technology(Microservices)and culture(devops)’
- Microservices
    - If you don’t end up regretting your early tech decisions, you probably over engineered 
    - Single purpose
    - Simple, well-defined interface
    - Module and independent
    - They are SOA’s done properly
    - Shared Data
        - There is one service that owns a particular kind of data.
        - Every other copy of the above data is a read-only , non authoritative cache.
        - Approach 1 : Synchronous Lookup
        - Approach 2:  Async event
        - Approach 3: shared metadata library
        - Transactions
            - No Two phase commit
            - Think of it as a saga(Think of about a workflow of events/)
            - To rollback apply compensating operations in reverse 
            - Serverless are one the best way of implementing these things.
            - 
        - Joins
            - Approach 1(1:N joins): Join in Client Application
            - Approach 2(M:N join): Materialize view
    - Have events(Something that I cared about happened) as a First Class Construct
        - Fourth fundamental block(State Changes-Events) which encourages architectural flexibility.
        - Events represent how the real world works 
        - Events are a first class interface part of an interface.
        - A service interface(any mechanism for getting data into and out of the service) includes
            - Synchronous request-response(ReST, grace..etc)
            - Events the service produces
            - Events the service consumes
            - Bulk reads and writes(ETL)
    - Isolated persistence (No backdoor to snick into other service data)
        - Only external access to data store is through published service interface
        - 
- Devops
    - E2e to ownership from design to deployment to retirement
    - Responsible for Features, quality, performance, operations and maintenance(You Build it you run it)
- TDD
    - Test help you go faster
    - Increases development velocity
    - Courage to refactor
    - Confidence to break things 
    - Catch bugs earlier 
    - Do it right enough the first time. 
        - Build one great thing instead of two half finished things
        - Right is not equal to Perfect.(80/20 rule)
        - The more constrained you are on time and resources , the more important it is to build a solid features
        - No bug tracking system 
    - Continous Delivery 
        - Depplyed multiple times a day
        - Rapid experimentations
        - Solid systems
            - Release smaller units of work
            - Smaller changes to roll back to roll forward
            - Faster to repair, easier to understand , simpler to diagnose
            - 
- Small teams
    - Cross functional teams
    - Depend on other teams for support
    - Aligned to business domains
    - Maintain a single service or a set related services
