# Say No
- Professionals say truth to power
- Good managers crave someone who has the power to say no
- Hard decisions are best made through the confrontation of  adversarial roles
- Your manager is dependending on you to defend your objectives just as he is defending his by pushing setting deadlines
- Be more assertive when negotiating
- Pursue an mutually agreeable goal during negotiations
- **Why** is a lot less important than the fact. Providing too much details can lead to micro managment.
- The **higher the stakes** , the more valuable it is to say no
- A **team player** communicates frequently, keeps an eye out for his or her colleagues
- A team player is not someone does says yes all the time
- If you not going to change some bahaviour, if you were reasonably confident in your estimates and if you dont have a new plan then **trying** is simply dishonest.
-  Think about the team as whole when dealing with passive aggressions.
