# Say No
- Professionals say truth to power
- Good managers crave someone who has the power to say no
- Hard decisions are best made through the confrontation of  adversarial roles
- Your manager is dependending on you to defend your objectives just as he is defending his by pushing setting deadlines
- Be more assertive when negotiating
- Pursue an mutually agreeable goal during negotiations
- **Why** is a lot less important than the fact. Providing too much details can lead to micro managment.
- The **higher the stakes** , the more valuable it is to say no
- A **team player** communicates frequently, keeps an eye out for his or her colleagues
- A team player is not someone does says yes all the time
- If you not going to change some bahaviour, if you were reasonably confident in your estimates and if you dont have a new plan then **trying** is simply dishonest.
-  Think about the team as whole when dealing with passive aggressions.
-  Sometimes the only way to get the right yes is to be unfraid to say no
-  Professional become heroes not because they try to be but when they get a job done well, on time and on a budget.
-  Acking unprofessionally will always reap unprofessional results
-  Saying yes to dropping your professional discipline is never the way to go


# Time management
- Profesionals are aware of the high cost of meetings and therefore are careful about meetings because they code to write  and their schedules to meet.
- Only accept meetings that your participation is significantly necessary to the job you are doing now.
- Be careful with meetings that just interesting , choose wisely.
- Sometimes you will have to confront a senior manager concerning meetings you have been invited to.
- A good manager will always try to keep you out of meetings.
- When a meeting is getting boring **leave**(Do it nicely)
- A meeting should have a clear Agenda and Goal
- Stand up meetings(What i did yesterday, what am i going to do today , whats in my way)- 1 min.
